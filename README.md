A minimal contract with a lock and redeem/refund mechanism.

## Overview

SafuNFT is a minimal contract with an integrated overridable mechanism to, optionally, lock your NFT when you mint it. If you decide to lock it, you will be unable to transfer it but have the option to get a refund during a duration defined by the deployer of the contract.

## Development


**Setup**
```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.


### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).
