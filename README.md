Backwards Compatible Template for Foundry and DappTools Projects.

## Overview

[femplate](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate) is intended to be minimal while also providing backwards compatibility. Thus, both [DappTools](https://dapp.tools/) and [Foundry](https://github.com/gaskonst/foundry) are supported. Installation instructions for both are included below.

## Getting Started

Click `use this template` on [Github](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Run `make rename` to rename all instances of `femplate` with the name of your project/repository.

## Blueprint

```ml
lib
â”œâ”€ ds-test â€” https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test
â”œâ”€ forge-std â€” https://github.com/brockelmore/forge-std
â”œâ”€ solmate â€” https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate
â”œâ”€ clones-with-immutable-args â€” https://github.com/wighawag/clones-with-immutable-args
src
â”œâ”€ tests
â”‚  â””â”€ Greeter.t â€” "Greeter Tests"
â””â”€ Greeter â€” "A Minimal Greeter Contract"
```

## Development


**Setup**
```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.


### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).
